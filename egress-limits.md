# Microsoft Artifact Registry (MAR) Egress Limits

Due to recent spikes in egress for MAR (also known as MCR) which resulted in significant impact to other Azure services (due to bandwidth limits), effective immediately, we are implementing egress limits to ensure the health of our platform. In case of egress spikes, clients will receive a HTTP 429 with the expectation that the clients will respect a backoff. This enforcement will be based in the locations where high egress is occurring and such enforcement has already occurred twice. For any additional questions, please submit a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/containerregistry/issues).
